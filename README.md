Welcome to the cram Algorithm Repository!
The way to read this repo is to go into \src\com\company\cramCalc
Within this file, the current working algorithm for the CRAM Game is hosted.
Please do not commit to the master without first ensuring that the changes you made have no errors.
Always include comments to your uploads. 
The playerMain and player2 java files have been created by Ryan, a classmate, for interfacing with the CRAM server.
This program should not be edited after the next repo commit from myself as I shall ensure that either playerMain or player2 can properly access and use the cramCalc algorithm that has been made. 
The current algorithm in the cramCalc file is random. It currently works for every case and ensures that every side and corner is checked for placement rules. 
If any errors are found and cannot be corrected personally, add a comment and I will fix it.
The reef branch is where I will be making my changes and work in progress alterations. Please make your own branch to work in if you want to make changes without commiting them to the master.
